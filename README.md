# Restaurant Finder

Uses a predetermined location coordinate to fetch a list of restaurants from the Google Places API, then display this list and respond to user ratings.

## Getting Started

The main project is divided into two parts:

[main.dart](https://github.com/scottblechman/flutter-demo/blob/master/lib/main.dart): holds UI construction and logic

[places.dart](https://github.com/scottblechman/flutter-demo/blob/master/lib/places.dart): holds place model data and network logic for accessing Places API
